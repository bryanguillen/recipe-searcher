# Recipe Searcher

## Summary 

The world wide web is great; one of the main reasons it is great is because of the amount of choices and level of ease with which we 
can make all of the choices. But, when searching for a simple item or idea, such as a recipe, using the search engines available can 
sometimes do more harm than good. The reason it does more harm sometimes when searching for recipes is because there are just way too 
many options. 

The 'Recipe Searcher' makes this much more simpler. For the most part, a person who knows how to cook, is just looking for interesting
recipes in order to make them. When you are looking for a recipe, you only need a few pieces of information. Those pieces of information 
include the name, the picture, amount of servings, calories, and most importantly, the ingredients. If you have a quick way to find
these ideas, naturally it would be a little more simpler and therefore easier. 

Below there are just some screenshots of the app on a desktop and smart phone.
